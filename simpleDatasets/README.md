# Simple Datasets for Practice

Datasets we find online are not always immediately ready to be turned into beautiful visualization. First, they might not be in a file format you are comfortable working with (`.json` and `.csv` are the most pleasant ones), and then of course they might contain many irregularities (missing information for *some* datapoints, "string" when there should be `numbers`, etc.).

I downloaded the below datasets and formated them myself, for you, so that we have a few datasets that we can very easily practice things with. Throughout the semester, you will experience "dirtier" datasets yourself, and learn from it!
